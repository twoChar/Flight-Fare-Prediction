## PROJECT TITLE : Flight Fare Prediction using Machine Learning 


## PROJECT DESCRIPTION : 
Travelling through flights has become an integral part of todayâ€™s lifestyle as more and more people are opting for faster travelling options. The flight ticket prices increase or decrease every now and then depending on various factors like timing of the flights, destination, and duration of flights various occasions such as vacations or festive season. Therefore, having some basic idea of the flight fares before planning the trip will surely help many people save money and time.


## PROJECT OBJECTIVE : 
The main goal is to build a machine learning model which should have an ability to predict the fares of the flights based on different factors available in the provided dataset and also using the classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. 


## DATASET DESCRIPTION :
The DATA folder contains two excel files - Data_Train.xlsx and Test_set.xlsx. 

Data_Train.xlsx file contains data of 10,684 instances when the flight tickets are available with respect to specific conditions  with specified fares. 

Test_set.xlsx file contains the data of 2672 instances where we have to predict the flight fare according to given test conditions using our machine learning model.

Training Data include airline flight information (Airline, Date of Journey, Source, Destination, etc.), along with the flight fare on  particular date.
